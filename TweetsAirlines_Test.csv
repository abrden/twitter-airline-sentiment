negative;American;"@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled"
negative;American;@AmericanAir their flights into Buffalo as well -- You were the only flight Cancelled Flightled!!!
negative;Southwest;@SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy 😣

negative;American;"@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying ""what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving"
negative;American;@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
negative;United;@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
negative;American;@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr

negative;American;@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service
negative;American;@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
negative;Southwest;@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
negative;American;@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
negative;American;@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is

negative;American;@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
negative;American;@AmericanAir guys 5350 in dfw  stuck at the gate for half an hour.  Do we pull the slide or what?

negative;American;@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
negative;American;@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
negative;United;@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option.
negative;American;@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
negative;Delta;@JetBlue But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous.
positive;Southwest;@SouthwestAir luv my companion pass!

negative;United;"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
negative;Delta;@JetBlue Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
negative;American;@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer
positive;US Airways;"@USAirways - Janet &amp; my DEN-PHL  flight Cancelled Flightled Saturday, USAIR rescheduled automatically &amp; notified us by email at no additional cost."

negative;American;@AmericanAir you're not finding it bc @united  rebooked us on your airline when they realized they couldn't get us home - and we're at ORD
negative;American;@AmericanAir because your plane's toilet wasn't working and they needed gas. This is flight 1081 leaving Dulles going to LAX. Do some...

negative;United;@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!

negative;American;@AmericanAir i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don't like myself?
negative;American;@AmericanAir pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine.

negative;United;@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
negative;American;@AmericanAir its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them
negative;American;"@AmericanAir TY! But, their site says "" Please note that we do not offer a print subscription service for American Way. ..."""
neutral;American;@AmericanAir yes. No one is answering and I'm on a train

negative;US Airways;@USAirways flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can't resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail
positive;United;@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?
neutral;US Airways;@USAirways agree! Richard P. Literally ripped up our tixs in our faces and made rude, inappropriate comments to us and our family. Awful!
negative;American;@AmericanAir aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers
positive;US Airways;@USAirways we were moved to a delta direct. Thank you for the accommodations!
negative;United;@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
negative;US Airways;@USAirways is not the new @AmericanAir is more like the new @SpiritAirlines. Love AA. Not impressed with the subpar planes and gate agents.
negative;United;@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
positive;American;@AmericanAir Believe me, I understand. Flight #2955. Was originally booked for Sunday. Flight was Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled for today.
negative;American;@AmericanAir sorry so Late Flight, responded to your DM.
negative;American;"@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible."
negative;American;@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal
negative;US Airways;@USAirways you're killing me from the inside
negative;Southwest;"@SouthwestAir Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can't get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!!"

positive;United;@united Thanks for taking care of that MR!! Happy customer.
positive;United;@united thanks
negative;American;@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
negative;American;@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
neutral;American;@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
neutral;US Airways;"@USAirways never received such horrible service or treated so poorly as Richard P. today. No excuse for attitude &amp; ripping up our tickets!"
negative;American;@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
neutral;Delta;@JetBlue flight 1041 to Savannah, GA
negative;US Airways;@USAirways just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite
neutral;US Airways;@USAirways Fortunately you have staff like Lynn S. and DeeDee who actually understand customer service and simply being NICE.
negative;Southwest;@SouthwestAir although I'm not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook
