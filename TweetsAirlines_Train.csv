negative;Delta;@JetBlue is REALLY getting on my nerves !! üò°üò° #nothappy
negative;United;@united yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.
negative;United;@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait
negative;Southwest;@SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it's coming, then not.
negative;United;@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion
negative;United;@united I like delays less than you because I'm the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher
negative;United;@united, link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can't yet tell what any problems are except see snow.
negative;Southwest;@SouthwestAir you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing?
negative;United;@united I tried 2 DM it would not go thru... not sure why
negative;United;Wanted to get my bag benefit, but instead get $25 pricing on all three tickets. When adding a card, MP Visa is only option. @united

negative;American;@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
negative;United;.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
negative;American;@AmericanAir we did for the last 8 hours.  Your customer service is horrendous.  I should have flown Delta
negative;American;@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted our flight and now are still delayed...NOT COOL.
negative;American;@AmericanAir not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone.

negative;American;@AmericanAir flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won't give luggage back. Nice.
negative;American;@AmericanAir yes. We spent the whole day talking to agents and someone finally offered to let him stay in a hotel
negative;American;@AmericanAir Flight's Cancelled Flightled. Website says to call phone number.Phone says to check online.  How am I supposed to get some help?
negative;United;@united why do you hate your passengers?
negative;US Airways;@USAirways A tweeted apology is not enough for delay fiasco. NONE for insult from gate agent is worse. Except for Mark N., all bad at CLT.
negative;American;@AmericanAir Trip cut 7 hrs short due to flight change/massive layovers/ no peanuts or crackers/ asked for H2O and received about 2oz.

negative;Delta;@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
negative;American;@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
negative;American;@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
negative;US Airways;@USAirways @PHLAirport this is the reason I avoid @PHLAirport and @USAirways like the plague. Glad to see this merger is working well. #dumb

negative;American;@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
negative;American;@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
negative;United;@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
negative;American;@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight

negative;United;@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
negative;American;"@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems"
negative;American;@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
negative;United;@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
negative;United;@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there.
negative;American;@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
negative;American;@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?

negative;US Airways;@USAirways in line for 90 min after mechanical issues caused me to miss my flight. 1 rep for 20 upset people. http://t.co/XFWXsRwkHa
negative;US Airways;@USAirways how is it that the airport (DCA) and the airline mess up our flights, but also will not cover our hotel costs? At DCA for 5hrs...
negative;US Airways;"@USAirways - flights 4500 AND 403 delayed for ""crew availability?""  What gives? I'm getting to TPA 2.5 hrs past my scheduled arrival."
negative;Delta;@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?
negative;Southwest;@SouthwestAir please start flying to Huntsville so I never have to fly American Airlines again
positive;Southwest;@SouthwestAir it's ok! Southwest is still the best airline around! Just hate when baggage room runs out.. My now checked bag has headphones!
negative;US Airways;@USAirways  Interesting you forward compliments but never complaints!  World's worst airline #GoingForGreatnessFAIL
negative;US Airways;@USAirways @PHLAirport we don't control your stupidity in not having room to have a plane come in. You better not mess with us now.
negative;American;@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
negative;Southwest;@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
negative;US Airways;@USAirways  flight missed due to mech issue. No food voucher, transported to different airport, no rental reimbursement üò°
negative;American;@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny
negative;US Airways;@USAirways 1st flight with U.S. Air Plane had mechanical issues. Wait 90 minutes for help from customer service. No help from management

positive;American;@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
negative;US Airways;"@USAirways Southern Hospitality luggage delivery service from SAV is AWFUL. Great @ delivering empty promises but not luggage #8hrs&amp;waiting"
negative;American;@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!
negative;Southwest;@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan.
negative;US Airways;@USAirways why won't you help me get my luggage back? I'm a teen trying to change the world in DC #Flight5182 #usairways
negative;Southwest;@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
negative;Delta;@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
neutral;American;@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?
negative;American;"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
negative;Delta;@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
negative;United;@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this
negative;United;@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
neutral;Delta;@JetBlue okay so anything using contactless EMV should work, just your internal testing and training is currently Apple Pay specific?
negative;United;@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
negative;Southwest;@SouthwestAir but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines.
